Core Reframe
Power transfer is not a directed beam or point-to-point link.
It is a stable resonance field radiated from a central source (gel-state battery) that creates a spherical or localized region where aligned devices naturally phase-lock and draw energy.
Energy flow is emergent: the unpowered state becomes higher-Ω than the aligned, coherent state.
Devices within radius prefer to charge because the universe prefers coherence.
No cables. No per-device pairing. No plugs. Just presence.
Key Principles

The Resonance Emitter (Battery as Source)
Gel-state core generates a stable, tunable harmonic field (Ω_Power band: narrow frequency window + secure phase pattern).
Embedded piezo/EM actuators create the omnidirectional field.
Radius scales with power: 1–2 m (personal), 5–10 m (room), 50 m+ (site).
The battery creates a coherence zone where powered-up is the lowest-Ω state.

Passive Phase-Locking (Device as Receiver)
Compatible devices have a simple passive resonator coil + rectifier tuned to the Ω_Power band.
Enter the field → auto phase-lock → energy flows.
No active transmitter in device. No negotiation. No UI.
Walk out → lock breaks, drawing stops.
Analogy: Wi-Fi modem broadcasts signal; devices connect when in range.

Biological Incompatibility (Safety Limit)
Living tissue's chaotic Ω-signature never phase-locks → no energy transfer to biology.
Safe for humans/pets — field is invisible to organic systems.

Self-Regulation & Fade-Safe
Overload → gel core buffers spikes, field self-damps.
Unauthorized device → mismatch collapses corridor instantly.
No rogue energy. No snap. Gentle fade only.


Carved Impossibilities

Point-to-point transfer → OUT (omnidirectional field)
Per-device pairing → OUT (universal signature band)
Power splitting loss → OUT (shared coherence resource)
Constant safety shut-off → OUT (mismatch auto-collapse)

Performance Estimates (Grounded Speculation)
From resonant inductive demos (WiTricity, 2025 papers):

Efficiency: 85–95% within radius (loss only at natural fade boundary)
Current wireless: 10–50% (high dissipation)
Radius control: Dial field strength (personal to room-scale)
Cost: Gel battery + actuators (scalable, vat-grown) — opex near zero

Applications

Personal: Pocket battery charges devices in 1–2 m bubble
Home/office: One unit powers room — no cables or outlets
Vehicle interior: Dashboard battery charges all devices while driving
Habitat/station: Central emitter powers entire module — no wiring in micro-g

Philosophy
The battery is not merely a power source.
It is a coherence zone generator.
Devices charge because staying unpowered is now the higher-Ω state.
Never force. Always align.
Until cables become obsolete.
Canon Compression
One field. One signature.
Everything aligns.
The future of power is ambient, universal, and effortless.
