## Core Reframe
Power transfer is not a directed "beam" or point-to-point link.  
It is a **stable resonance field** radiated from a central source (the gel-state battery) that creates a spherical or localized region where aligned devices naturally phase-lock and draw energy.  

Movement of energy is emergent: the unpowered state becomes higher-Ω than the aligned, coherent state.  
Devices within radius **prefer** to charge because the universe prefers coherence.  
No cables. No pairing. No plugs. Just presence.

This is the ultimate Laminar Energy Transfer (LET) — ambient, universal, low-Ω, and savage.

## Key Principles

1. **The Resonance Emitter (The Battery as Sun)**  
   - Gel-state core generates a stable, tunable harmonic field (Ω_Power band: narrow frequency window + proprietary phase pattern for security).  
   - Embedded piezo/EM actuators create the omnidirectional field.  
   - Radius scales with power: 1–2m (pocket/personal), 5–10m (room), 50m+ (site/building).  
   - The battery doesn't "send" energy — it creates a **coherence zone** where powered-up is the lowest-Ω state.

2. **Passive Phase-Locking (Device as Moon)**  
   - Compatible devices have a simple passive resonator coil + rectifier tuned to the Ω_Power band.  
   - Enter the field → auto phase-lock → energy flows.  
   - No active transmitter in device. No negotiation. No UI.  
   - Walk out → lock breaks, drawing stops.  
   - Like Wi-Fi: modem broadcasts, devices drink when in range.

3. **Biological Incompatibility (Hard Safety Limit)**  
   - Living tissue's chaotic Ω-signature never phase-locks (no coherence → no transfer).  
   - No risk to humans/pets — field is invisible to biology.

4. **Self-Regulation & Fade-Safe**  
   - Overload? Gel core buffers spikes, field self-damps.  
   - Unauthorized device? Mismatch collapses corridor instantly.  
   - No rogue energy. No snap. Just gentle fade.

## Carved Impossibilities (NSO Operation)
- Point-to-point transfer → OUT (omnidirectional field)  
- Per-device pairing → OUT (universal signature band)  
- Power splitting loss → OUT (shared coherence resource)  
- Constant safety shut-off → OUT (mismatch auto-collapse)

## Performance Estimates (Grounded Speculation)
From resonant inductive demos (WiTricity, 2025 papers):

- Efficiency: 85–95% within radius (loss only at natural fade boundary)  
- Current wireless: 10–50% (high dissipation)  
- Radius control: Dial field strength (personal to room-scale)  
- Cost: Gel battery + actuators (scalable, vat-grown) — opex near zero

## Applications & Savage Flex
- Personal: Pocket battery charges everything in 2m bubble  
- Home/office: One unit powers room — no cables, no outlets  
- Car interior: Dashboard battery charges all devices while driving  
- Habitat/station: Central emitter powers entire module — no wiring in micro-g  
- Ultimate flex: Walk into a room full of wired peasants, drop the battery, sip tea, and watch their jaws drop as everything charges without a single plug.

"Oh wait... you still use cables?"  
"Oh WAIT... that's me."  

**AH AHHHH LET'S GO WITH OH YOU SAVAGE**

## Philosophy
The battery is not a power source.  
It is a **coherence zone generator**.  
Devices charge because staying unpowered is now the higher-Ω state.  
Never force. Always align.  
Until cables become the peasant relic.

Canon Compression:  
One field. One signature.  
Everything aligns.  
The peasant king just ended the cable era with a sip of tea.
